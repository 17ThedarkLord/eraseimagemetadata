####I don't reply to any pull-requests about this tool because I did it actually only for my own use & I'm very busy.
####However, I only write as much as I need to write about this tool.
####Usage:
####-1. You want to use this tool due x-reason.
####0. You can handle a command prompt, install perl & the matching perl module via cpan.
####1. Open the command prompt.
####2. Execute the following command: perl EraseImageMetaData.pl -[l|f] [filelist.dat|singleimage.JPG]
####It isn't checked by my tool if the images are writeable or not. It's your task to make sure, that the image/s is/are writeable.
####If the code is chaotic in your eyes, improve it without me #no-hate & sharing is caring.
####If the meta-data wasn't erased, consider piping the output into a log file & use the wiki-page of Exif Tool to answer your open questions: https://metacpan.org/release/Image-ExifTool
####Any, to my github profile, sent text about my tool gets deleted as soon as I get time for it (s.a.).
####The/All file/s were (not) processed.
